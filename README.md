# introduction
the most downbad compression algorithm ever made

OK, so I've designed a compression algorithm (the thing that compresses stuff in 7zip or WinRAR) which actually works? For some reason? Will add code + documentation later.

as for the naming part...i ran out of good names okay ðŸ˜­

# Keywords
`REP`: The amount of times the software is repeated.
`baseA`, `baseB`: The number that an input is converted to.
`N`: The size of a text group
